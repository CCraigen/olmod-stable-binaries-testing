## Branches

Use the branch that best suits your needs.

### Main

The latest stable release of olmod.  Use this branch if you want the most commonly run version of olmod.

### Testing

Sometimes olmod issues release candidates.  Use this branch if you are interested in the latest testing version.  Testing builds are rare, however, so this version will most often be synced with the main branch.
